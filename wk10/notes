ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES 
- $HOME, $PATH 
- These are called environment variables
- This is our environment -> the information a process might
look at while it's running
- THe env is basically just a list of information
- Environment is a list of environment variable 


PHYSICAL & VIRTUAL MEMORY
- How the operating system delegates memory to different processes
- Limited amount of physical memory 

- most basic way of loading processes:
    - loading all at once, right next to each other 
    - not really a feasible way 

- what's the proper way?
    - separate a process' memory (code, data, stack, heap) into FIXED size
    blocks called pages 
    - separate physical memory into FIXED sized blocks called frames
- Benefits:
    - doesn't have to load the whole process
    - doesn't have to load processes contiguously (next to each other) 
        -> pages can be in separate places
- Process' POV: doesn't care about other processes 
    - think as if you have infinite memory
    - virtual memory - process' POV of memory


STEPS FOR VADDR -> PADDR:
1. Figure out what page it's in
