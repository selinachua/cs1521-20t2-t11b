1. What does fopen(3) do? What are its parameters?
- path is file name
- mode is r, w, a (could be followed by +) -> use man

2. What are some circumstances when fopen(3) returns NULL?
- file doesn't exist 
- corrupt file 
- you don't have permission for that file
- you've run out of memory

int *p = 
FILE *fp = fopen(path, mode);
fgetc, fputc
fclose(fp);
