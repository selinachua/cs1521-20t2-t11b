4. 
- w actually truncates the whole file -> it rewrites the whole file 
- a = append -> adds on the end of the file 

6.
- lseek doesn't actually write at all 
- it only moves the offset of the file descriptor 

7. SEEK_SET -> from the beginning of the file
8. SEEK_END -> from the end of the file
10, 000 + 500 = 10, 500
- go past the end because you can add on to the end of the file
- does not give an error!
