WHAT IS A TREE?
linked list:
struct node {
	int val;
	struct node *next;
};
1 -> 2 -> X

tree:
struct node {
	int val;
	struct node *left;
	struct node *right;
}

a) What is the full pathname of COMP1521's web directory?
/home/cs1521/web

b) Which directory is ~jas/../..?
/
.. -> goes up one directory -> goes back to the parent directory

c) Links to the children of a given directory are stored as entries in the 
directory structure. Where is the link to the parent directory stored?
..

d) What kind of filesystem object is cat?
cat -> prints the contents of a file into stdout
cat -> binary file, something that you can execute

e) What kind of filesystem object is home?
home -> directory

f) What kind of filesystem object is tty0?
tty0 -> a file stream that represents a device
e.g. keyboard

g) What kind of filesystem object is a symbolic link? What value does it contain?
- symbolic link a file that contains a link to another file 
- web -symlink-> public_html
- web is a file that contains a link to the public_html file
- every time we reference web, we get redirected public_html

h) Symbolic links change the filesystem from a tree structure to a graph 
structure. How do they do this?

- when files are stored in memory -> information about the file itself is also stored 
- file metadata: information about the file itself:
	- its size
	- date created
	- permissions
	- type
- stat is a function that allows us to get file metadata 
- stat fills up a struct stat 

Explain what each of the fields represents:

struct stat {
	ino_t st_ino;         /* inode number */
	mode_t st_mode;       /* protection */
	uid_t st_uid;         /* user ID of owner */
	gid_t st_gid;         /* group ID of owner */
	off_t st_size;        /* total size, in bytes */
	blksize_t st_blksize; /* blocksize for filesystem I/O */
	blkcnt_t st_blocks;   /* number of 512B blocks allocated */
	time_t st_atime;      /* time of last access */
	time_t st_mtime;      /* time of last modification */
	time_t st_ctime;      /* time of last status change */
};

st_ino:  file number, index for the file
st_mode: permissions
st_uid:  user id 
st_gid:  group id
st_size: total size, in bytes
st_blksize: size of 1 block 
st_blocks: # of blocks 
if blksize = 10B
file size = 30B
blocks = 3
st_atime:
st_mtime:
st_ctime:

a) Who can access the 17s2.work directory?
anyone can cd into a directory
you need read permission to do 'ls' -> other can't 'ls'

b) What operations can a typical user perform on the public_html directory?
- can only execute 
- they can't ls 
- they can't change contents of any files
- if they know the name of a file, they can run it 

c) What is the file web?
- Symbolic link to public_html 

d) What is the difference between stat("web", &info) and lstat("web", &info)?
(where info is an object of type (struct stat))
stat("web", &info):
gives information about public_html 

lstat("web", &info)
gives information about web
