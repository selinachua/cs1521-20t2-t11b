MIPS Data (.data)
- Everything (variables) in C require memory
- Allocated at compile time (gcc) -> static allocation
- Things that are statically allocated:
    - Global and static variables 
    - Arrays -> int arr[100]
    - Strings

- These things exist in memory 
LOAD into reg -> modify it -> SAVE into memory
